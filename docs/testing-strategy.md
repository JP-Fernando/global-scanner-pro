# Testing Strategy Guide

**Global Quant Scanner Pro - Testing Infrastructure**

**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 COMPLETED
**Last Updated**: January 2026
**Version**: 0.0.6

---

## 📋 Overview

This document details the testing strategy for Global Quant Scanner Pro, including the current test implementation, Phase 1 security tests, and the roadmap for comprehensive testing coverage in Phase 2.

---

## 🧪 1. Current Test Infrastructure

### Test Files

- [src/tests/tests.js](../src/tests/tests.js) - Main test suite (50 tests)
- [src/tests/phase1-tests.js](../src/tests/phase1-tests.js) - Phase 1 security tests (10+ tests)
- [src/tests/ml-tests.js](../src/tests/ml-tests.js) - Machine learning tests

### Custom Test Framework

The current implementation uses a custom assertion framework built on Node.js's native `assert` module.

**Features**:
- ✅ Simple assertion API
- ✅ Test grouping with `describe`
- ✅ Colored output (pass/fail)
- ✅ Test statistics (passed/failed/total)

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ No coverage reporting
- ⚠️ No parallel execution
- ⚠️ No watch mode
- ⚠️ Limited assertion types

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests via API
npm run test:api

# Run Phase 1 tests only
node src/tests/phase1-tests.js
```

## 🎯 4. Phase 2 Testing Roadmap

### 4.1 Test Framework Migration (Vitest)

**Goal**: Migrate to modern test framework

**Actions**:
- Install Vitest and dependencies
- Configure `vitest.config.js`
- Migrate existing tests to Vitest syntax
- Set up coverage reporting
- Add test UI for debugging

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 of Phase 2

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests migrated and passing
- Coverage reports generated
- Tests run faster than before

### 4.2 Expand Unit Test Coverage

**Goal**: Achieve 80%+ coverage for critical modules

**Priority Modules**:

1. **Core Scanner** ([src/core/scanner.js](../src/core/scanner.js))
   - Market data fetching
   - Indicator calculation
   - Scoring logic
   - Error handling

2. **Risk Analytics** ([src/analytics/risk_engine.js](../src/analytics/risk_engine.js))
   - VaR calculation
   - CVaR calculation
   - Correlation matrices
   - Stress testing

3. **Portfolio Optimizer** ([src/analytics/portfolio-optimizer.js](../src/analytics/portfolio-optimizer.js))
   - Maximum Sharpe optimization
   - Minimum variance optimization
   - Risk parity allocation
   - Constraint handling

4. **ML Components** ([src/ml/](../src/ml/))
   - Model training and prediction
   - Factor weighting
   - Regime detection
   - Anomaly detection

5. **Alert System** ([src/alerts/alert-manager.js](../src/alerts/alert-manager.js))
   - Threshold monitoring
   - Notification sending
   - Alert history

**Timeline**: Week 2-4 of Phase 2

### 4.3 Integration Tests

**Goal**: Verify components work together correctly

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **End-to-End Scanning**
   - Fetch market data → Calculate indicators → Score → Rank
   - Verify data flow between modules
   - Test error propagation

2. **Portfolio Construction**
   - Score assets → Optimize allocation → Apply constraints
   - Test with various optimization methods
   - Verify constraint compliance

3. **Alert Triggering**
   - Monitor thresholds → Trigger alerts → Send notifications
   - Test with mock notification services
   - Verify alert history storage

4. **Database Operations**
   - Store → Retrieve → Update → Delete
   - Test data persistence
   - Verify IndexedDB operations

**Timeline**: Week 5-6 of Phase 2

### 4.4 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Goal**: Test user-facing functionality

**Framework**: Playwright

The runner compiles server modules before starting an isolated local test server. It uses
`http://localhost:3107` by default, configures CORS for that origin and uses an in-memory auth
database. Normal runs require a free test port and do not reuse a development/production
server or Docker container. Browser contexts isolate IndexedDB/localStorage per test.

```bash
npm run test:e2e:chromium
E2E_PORT=3207 npm run test:e2e:chromium
# Explicit reuse of an intentionally prepared test server (disabled in CI):
E2E_REUSE_SERVER=1 npm run test:e2e:chromium
```

Desktop regression specs cover scan/results, real saved portfolio/dashboard navigation,
alerts, simulator request/error/selection flows and offline review. Simulator UI responses
are deterministic fixtures; numerical engine correctness is tested separately.
Shared frontend modules are included in the Vitest coverage gate.

`npm run test:e2e:android` runs the dedicated Android task flow at 360/390/430 px on Chromium.
The normal Chromium suite includes these tests alongside desktop regressions.
`npm run test:e2e:build` builds a static-hosting subpath variant, serves it from an ephemeral
local port, verifies the Android and desktop offline shells, then restores the normal build.
This checks actual production assets independently of Express's development module paths.
It requires the Playwright Chromium browser installed, as does the normal E2E suite.

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Market Scanning Journey**
   - Select market
   - Choose strategy
   - Run analysis
   - View results
   - Sort and filter

2. **Portfolio Construction**
   - Select top assets
   - Build portfolio
   - View optimization results
   - Export report

3. **Alert Configuration**
   - Create alert rule
   - Configure notifications
   - Test alert triggering
   - View alert history

4. **Dashboard Navigation**
   - Navigate between views
   - Interact with charts
   - Export data
   - Responsive design

**Timeline**: Week 7-8 of Phase 2

## 🔧 5. Testing Best Practices

### Unit Tests

**Do**:
- ✅ Test one thing per test
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- ✅ Mock external dependencies
- ✅ Test edge cases and error conditions

**Don't**:
- ❌ Test implementation details
- ❌ Share state between tests
- ❌ Make tests depend on each other
- ❌ Test third-party libraries
- ❌ Write tests that are slower than necessary

### Integration Tests

**Do**:
- ✅ Test realistic scenarios
- ✅ Use test databases/fixtures
- ✅ Clean up after tests
- ✅ Test error handling
- ✅ Verify data integrity

**Don't**:
- ❌ Use production data
- ❌ Test everything (focus on critical paths)
- ❌ Make tests too complex
- ❌ Ignore flaky tests
- ❌ Skip cleanup

### E2E Tests

**Do**:
- ✅ Test critical user journeys
- ✅ Use page object pattern
- ✅ Take screenshots on failure
- ✅ Test across browsers
- ✅ Keep tests independent

**Don't**:
- ❌ Test every possible interaction
- ❌ Use hardcoded waits (use smart waits)
- ❌ Test implementation details
- ❌ Ignore performance
- ❌ Make tests too brittle

## 🚀 7. Running Tests in CI

### GitHub Actions Integration

All tests run automatically in CI:

```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm test
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        files: ./coverage/lcov.info
```

### Coverage Reporting

**Current**: No automated coverage reporting

**Planned (Phase 2)**:
- Codecov integration
- Coverage badges in README
- Coverage trends over time
- PR coverage checks

---

## 🔍 8. Test Data Management

### Fixtures

Test data stored in `src/tests/fixtures/`:

```javascript
// Example fixture structure
{
  marketData: {
    symbol: 'AAPL',
    prices: [150, 152, 151, 153],
    timestamps: [/* ... */]
  },
  indicators: {
    rsi: [45, 52, 48, 55],
    macd: [/* ... */]
  }
}
```

### Mocks

Mock external services:

```javascript
// Yahoo Finance API mock
const mockYahooData = {
  chart: {
    result: [{
      timestamp: [/* ... */],
      indicators: {
        quote: [{
          close: [150, 152, 151]
        }]
      }
    }]
  }
};
```
